# Feature-Engineering-and-Data-Modeling
This project explores detecting cyberattacks using network traffic analysis and machine learning. Two VMs (attacker/victim) are set up via MIF OpenNebula, with tcpdump capturing traffic in .pcap format. Extracted features like HTTP methods and URIs are used to train a Random Forest model to detect malicious behavior.
